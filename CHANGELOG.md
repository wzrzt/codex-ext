# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 0.6.8 — 2026-10-30

- Open new drafts through the official Codex command. This restores the
  official conversation UI and avoids unsupported custom URI parameters.

## 0.6.7 — 2026-10-29

- New official Codex editors are now tracked as temporary drafts: no local
  thread is created until the first message is sent.
- After that first message, Codex Ext detects the newly created thread,
  refreshes the session manager, and automatically binds it to the workspace
  that opened the draft.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-10-25

- Keep official Codex conversation editors open after a rename. This avoids
  interrupting in-progress responses; the title is refreshed in Codex Ext's
  session manager only.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-10-25

- After a rename made in Codex Ext, reopen the matching official Codex editor
  so its native VS Code tab refreshes to the new title.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-10-25

- Fixed **New session** so every click opens a distinct official Codex
  conversation editor instead of reusing a previously opened blank editor.
- Show a visible error notification if a session action cannot be completed.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-10-25

- Reworked Marketplace documentation around installation and everyday use.
- Removed local development and obsolete VSIX instructions from the public
  extension page.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-25

- Added a single, continuous Claude Code-inspired sidebar layout.
- Added account, plan, and official Codex allowance display.
- Added workspace/all-session tabs, title search, groups, archiving, and
  drag-and-drop group/archive management.
- Added English and Simplified Chinese localization.
