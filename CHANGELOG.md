# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Reveal already-open Codex chats in their current editor group. Other chats
  and drafts open in the group active when the action was invoked.
- Add a Codex editor-title action to create a new chat in that group.
- Add `codexWorkspaceSessions.chatGroupLocking` with `off`, `chatOnly` (default),
  and `containsChat` modes to route new files outside matching chat groups.
  Target locks by group resource and release managed locks when the group no
  longer matches or the setting is disabled.
- Add a per-tab reload action, including for drafts. Open a fresh editor in the
  original group before closing the old tab, retain the original on failed open
  or refused close, and serialize rapid reloads. Session selection reuses the
  existing tab after reload.

## 0.6.16 — 2026-11-03

- Refresh the Marketplace and GitHub introduction to describe Remote-SSH
  session management, the local usage bridge, and per-tab reload support.

## 0.6.15 — 2026-11-03

- Read SQLite sessions through portable hex-encoded rows instead of the
  version-specific `sqlite3 -json` option; internal Guardian review sessions
  no longer appear when SQLite is available.
- Filter Guardian reviews from the JSONL fallback as a defensive measure.
- Add **Reload Current Codex Tab** to the open Codex tab's right-click menu,
  allowing a failed official editor to be recreated without reloading VS Code.

## 0.6.14 — 2026-11-03

- Restore the main extension to the Remote-SSH workspace host, so it reads and
  manages the SSH host's Codex sessions rather than macOS sessions.
- Move account usage to a dedicated local bridge extension, allowing remote
  sessions and local account usage to coexist.

## 0.6.13 — 2026-11-02

- Remove the cross-host hard dependency on OpenAI Codex. Codex Ext can now
  activate its sidebar in Remote-SSH even when the official extension runs in
  a different extension host.

## 0.6.12 — 2026-11-01

- Add a local ChatGPT Desktop Codex CLI fallback for Remote-SSH account usage
  on macOS, even if the official VS Code extension is installed remotely.
- Show the concrete Account & Usage failure in the sidebar, including a clear
  instruction when Codex Ext was installed on the SSH host instead of locally.

## 0.6.11 — 2026-11-01

- Fix Account & Usage for Remote SSH and Dev Containers by running Codex Ext
  in VS Code's local UI extension host, alongside the official Codex account.

## 0.6.10 — 2026-11-01

- Updated the Marketplace description and README to reflect the current
  workspace session manager, account usage, search, grouping, archive, and
  official-draft behavior.

## 0.6.9 — 2026-10-30

- Give each official Codex draft a unique URI fragment. New session now opens
  a separate official draft tab instead of refocusing an existing one.

## 0.6.8 — 2026-10-30

- Open new drafts through the official Codex command. This restores the
  official conversation UI and avoids unsupported custom URI parameters.

## 0.6.7 — 2026-10-29

- New official Codex editors are now tracked as temporary drafts: no local
  thread is created until the first message is sent.
- After that first message, Codex Ext detects the newly created thread,
  refreshes the session manager, and automatically binds it to the workspace
  that opened the draft.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-10-25

- Keep official Codex conversation editors open after a rename. This avoids
  interrupting in-progress responses; the title is refreshed in Codex Ext's
  session manager only.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-10-25

- After a rename made in Codex Ext, reopen the matching official Codex editor
  so its native VS Code tab refreshes to the new title.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-10-25

- Fixed **New session** so every click opens a distinct official Codex
  conversation editor instead of reusing a previously opened blank editor.
- Show a visible error notification if a session action cannot be completed.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-10-25

- Reworked Marketplace documentation around installation and everyday use.
- Removed local development and obsolete VSIX instructions from the public
  extension page.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-25

- Added a single, continuous Claude Code-inspired sidebar layout.
- Added account, plan, and official Codex allowance display.
- Added workspace/all-session tabs, title search, groups, archiving, and
  drag-and-drop group/archive management.
- Added English and Simplified Chinese localization.
