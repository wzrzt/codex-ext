# Codex Ext

`Codex Ext` is an independent VS Code extension for managing local OpenAI
Codex sessions. It adds a **Codex Ext** icon to VS Code's left Activity Bar
and lets you view sessions belonging to the current workspace or every
available local session.

## Install

1. In VS Code, open the Extensions view (`⇧⌘X` on macOS).
2. Search for **Codex Ext** and install the extension published by **wzrzt**.
3. Install and enable the official **OpenAI Codex** extension.
4. Reload VS Code if prompted, then choose the **Codex Ext** icon in the left
   Activity Bar.

You can also install it from a terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension wzrzt.codex-ext
```

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.96 or newer
- [OpenAI Codex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt)
  (`openai.chatgpt`)

The extension opens sessions in the leftmost existing editor group through the
official Codex conversation editor.

It reads Codex Desktop's local thread state to retain the same user-facing
titles, workspace associations, and archive state as Codex. If that state is
unavailable, it falls back to `session_index.jsonl`. Rename, archive, and
restore use the app-server bundled with the official Codex extension; this
keeps changes consistent with Codex without directly editing its local state.

The single, continuous sidebar follows the compact Claude Code layout. Its
**Account & Usage** section shows
the signed-in email, plan, one progress bar per available Codex allowance
window, and its reset time. The **Session Manager** panel below has a tab-style
**Workspace / All sessions** switch, a search field, and a new-session action.
The session list follows directly below it and retains groups, archive, and restore. Account usage is not a conversation token estimate.

## Usage

1. Install and enable the official OpenAI Codex extension.
2. Open a folder or multi-root workspace.
3. Click the **Codex Ext** icon in VS Code's left Activity Bar.
4. Use the **Workspace / All sessions** tabs to choose the scope. It applies
   to both active and archived sessions. Type in the search field to filter
   titles in the selected scope.
5. Active sessions are organized into **Ungrouped** and user-defined groups.
   Drag a session to a group to move it; drag it to **Archived** to archive it.
   Drag an archived session back to an active group to restore and move it.
   Group data is stored per VS Code workspace.
6. The **Archived** group follows the same scope filter. Clicking an archived
   row, or its restore action, restores that exact session to the active list.
   Rename, archive, and restore update the actual Codex conversation.
7. Existing sessions are matched to their original workspace from Codex's local
   session metadata. Opening a session also binds it to the current workspace
   automatically, covering sessions whose metadata is unavailable.
8. Use the search field to filter titles. Click a session to open it in a
   Codex editor tab.

The extension follows VS Code's display language. English is the default and
Simplified Chinese is provided when VS Code uses `zh-cn`.

Bindings are held in VS Code `workspaceState`; each workspace keeps an
independent `sessionId → workspaceHash` mapping. Workspace identifiers are
SHA-256 hashes rather than raw paths.

## Privacy and data handling

- Session titles, local workspace metadata, and archive state are read from
  the local Codex state on your computer; they are not sent to a Codex Ext
  service.
- Account and allowance data are requested from the official Codex extension's
  local app-server only.
- Session grouping and workspace bindings are stored in VS Code
  `workspaceState` for the current workspace.
